# niftycaster

This is a prototype of a tool that will aggregate NFT stats of Farcaster users; in a more complete form, it will store most recent data in a database and perform calculations on them. The tool will allow users to see which NFTs are most popular NFTs owned by Farcasters, as well as the total market cap of the owned assets, as well as total profits gained in the last week.
